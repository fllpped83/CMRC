# CMRC
DNA storage has ultra-high storage density and storage time, which can store rich literature and cultural heritage in a very small space for almost permanent preservation. However, the existing DNA storage encoding methods are mainly for English text and binary data storage, and DNA storage encoding algorithms for Chinese text have not been widely researched and developed due to the large size of the Chinese character set and the long UTF-8 encoding of a single character. Therefore, this paper designs a Chinese Mutli-Rule Rule coding (CMRC) scheme for Chinese text storage. Firstly, the conversion model of Chinese characters is established by the character codes rules, then the conversion system between data and DNA sequences is constructed by using forward and reverse code table mapping, and finally the data is rewritten by sequence reorganisation to generate DNA sequences with high storage density and good coding quality. The results show that this scheme improves the storage density by 1.5% and reduces the minimum free energy by 5% compared with the current optimal scheme, and ensures the GC content in the range of 45% to 55%. Secondly, the maximum length of homopolymer is limited to 3 units, and the content of undesired motifs is lower than 0.6%, which is more than 40% lower compared to other representative schemes. This not only highlights the great potential of DNA storage in Chinese literature preservation, but also provides a new perspective and method for the inheritance of global cultural heritage.
